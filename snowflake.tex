\begin{abstract}
Snowflake is a system for circumventing Internet censorship.
Its blocking resistance comes from
the use of numerous, ultra-light, temporary proxies (``snowflakes''),
which accept traffic from censored clients using peer-to-peer WebRTC protocols
and forward it to a centralized bridge.
The temporary proxies are simple enough to be implemented in JavaScript,
in~a web page or browser extension,
making them much cheaper to run than
a traditional proxy or VPN server.
The large and constantly changing pool
of proxy addresses resists enumeration and blocking by a censor.
The system is built on the assumption
that proxies may appear or disappear at any time:
clients discover live proxies dynamically
using a secure rendezvous protocol;
when an \mbox{in-use} proxy goes offline,
its client switches to another on the fly,
invisibly to upper network layers.

Snowflake has been deployed with success
in Tor Browser and Orbot for several years.
It has been a significant circumvention tool
during high-profile network disruptions,
including in Russia in~2021 and Iran in~2022.
In this paper, we explain the composition of Snowflake's many parts,
give a history of deployment and blocking attempts,
and reflect on implications for circumvention generally.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Snowflake is a censorship circumvention system,
a~system to enable network communication
despite interference by a censor.
Its blocking resistance comes from a large pool
of low-cost, temporary proxies
that varies over time
and offers a censor no fixed target for blocking.
The core research purpose of this paper
is to investigate experimentally to what extent
a circumvention system that makes the tradeoffs Snowflake does
can be effective against contemporary censors.
We~will present the design of the system,
listing the many challenges of circumvention
and showing how Snowflake addresses them.
We~will explain how Snowflake solves the technical challenge
of providing a good user experience
when proxies are individually unreliable.
We~will document the reactions of national censors
through case studies in
Russia, Iran, China, and Turkmenistan
over more than three years of deployment.
On~the way we will provide quantitative evaluations
of various facets of the system,
including the number of clients served,
and the size and composition of the proxy pool.

Censorship circumvention systems may
be characterized on multiple axes.
Some systems imitate a common network protocol;
others try
not to look like any protocol in particular.
Some distribute connections over numerous proxy servers;
others concentrate on a single proxy
that is, for one reason or another, difficult for a censor to block.
What all circumvention systems have in common
is that they strive to increase the \emph{cost}
to the censor of blocking them---whether that cost be in
research and development, human resources, and hardware;
or in the inevitable overblocking that results
when a censor tries to selectively block
some connections but not others.
On~the spectrum of imitation to randomization,
Snowflake falls on the side of imitation;
on the scale of diffuse to concentrated, it is diffuse.
Snowflake's defining characteristic is that it
pushes the idea of distributed, disposable
proxies to an extreme.

WebRTC is a suite of protocols
intended for real-time communication applications
on the web~\cite{rfc8825}.
Video and voice chat are typical applications.
Snowflake exchanges WebRTC data formats
in the course of establishing a connection,
and uses WebRTC protocols to traverse of NAT (network address translation)
and to connect clients and proxies.
Crucially for Snowflake, WebRTC APIs
are available to JavaScript code in web browsers,
meaning it is possible to implement a proxy
in a web page or browser extension.
WebRTC is also usable outside a browser,
which is how we implement the Snowflake client program
and alternative, command line--based proxies.

As~is usual in circumvention research,
we assume a threat model in which
\firstterm{clients} reside in a network
controlled by a \firstterm{censor}.
The censor has the power to inspect and interfere with
traffic that crosses the border of its network;
typical real-world censor behaviors include
inspecting IP addresses and hostnames,
checking packet contents for keywords,
blocking IP addresses, and injecting false DNS responses
and TCP RST packets.
The client wants to communicate with some
\firstterm{destination} outside the censor's network,
possibly with the aid of third-party \firstterm{proxies}.
The censor is motivated to block the contents
of the client's communication, or the destination itself.
The censor knows of the possibility of circumvention,
and therefore seeks to block not only direct communication with the destination,
but also indirect communication by way of a proxy or circumvention system.
Circumvention is accomplished when the client
can reliably reach any proxy,
because a proxy, being outside the censor's control,
can then forward the client's communication to any destination.
(In Snowflake, we separate the roles of temporary \firstterm{proxies}
and a stable long-term \firstterm{bridge}, but the idea is the same.)
The censor derives benefit
from permitting some forms of network access:
it~cannot trivially ``win''
by shutting down all communication,
but must be selective in its blocking decisions,
in order to optimize some objective of its own.
The art of censorship circumvention is
forcing the censor into a dilemma
of~overblocking or underblocking,
by making circumvention traffic difficult to distinguish
from traffic that the censor prefers not to block.

Snowflake originates in two earlier projects:
flash proxy and uProxy.
% https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2016-January/010310.html "Snowflake is a webrtc pluggable transport inspired by flashproxy."
% https://keroserene.net/snowflake/technical/#1-introduction "It is inspired by and builds upon the previous work of Flashproxy. Snowflake is much like a hybrid of previous Pluggable Transports..."
Flash proxy~\cite{Fifield2012a}, like Snowflake, used
untrusted temporary JavaScript proxies in web browsers
forwarding to a central bridge,
but the link between client and proxy was WebSocket
rather than WebRTC,
which was then an emerging technology.
Flash proxy was deployed
% 2013: https://blog.torproject.org/combined-flash-proxy-pyobfsproxy-browser-bundles
% 2016: "Remove Flashproxy from Tor Browser" https://bugs.torproject.org/17428#note_2203210
from 2013 to~2016,
but never saw much use,
probably because WebSocket,
which lacks the built-in NAT traversal of WebRTC,
required clients to do complicated port forwarding.
% https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/PluggableTransports/FlashProxy/Howto
% https://serene.cx/snowflake/#note-flashproxy "...one could say that uProxy and flashproxy are the ancestors of snowflake."
uProxy~\cite{uproxy}, in one of its early incarnations,
% "in one of its earlier incarnations": uProxy pivoted from friend proxies to cloud servers in 2016:
% https://web.archive.org/web/20161211194847/https://blog.uproxy.org/2016/02/get-access-24x7-through-your-own-uproxy.html
% and added support for proxying through Tor in 2016:
% https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2016-September/011489.html
pioneered the use of WebRTC proxies for circumvention.
uProxy's proxies were browser-based,
but its trust and deployment model was different
from flash proxy's and Snowflake's.
Censored clients would arrange, out of band,
for an acquaintance outside the censor's network
to run a proxy in their browser~\cite{uproxy-design-doc}.
% uProxy v1.2.5 Design Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t_30vX7RcrEGuWwcg0Jub-HiNI0Ko3kBOyqXgrQN3Kw
% "uProxy depends on leveraging existing trust relationships to to find and use a proxy."
A~personal trust relationship was necessary to prevent misuse,
since browser proxies fetched destination content directly---meaning
client activity would be attributed to the proxy,
and the proxy might inspect the client's traffic.
Clients did not change proxies on the fly.
uProxy supported protocol obfuscation:
its packets could be transformed to resemble something
other than WebRTC.
% https://github.com/uProxy/uproxy-obfuscators
This was possible because of
uProxy's implementation as a privileged browser extension
with access to real sockets.
Because Snowflake uses ordinary unprivileged APIs,
its WebRTC can only look like WebRTC;
on the other hand, for the same reason,
Snowflake proxies are easier to deploy.
Like flash proxy, uProxy was active in the years
2013--2016.

Among existing circumvention systems,
the one that is most similar to Snowflake is MassBrowser~\cite{Nasr2020a},
% reading group summary of MassBrowser https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/32
which offers
proxying though volunteer proxies, called buddies.
MassBrowser's architecture is similar to Snowflake's:
there is a centralized component that coordinates
connections between clients and buddies,
which corresponds to a piece in Snowflake called the broker;
buddies are similar to our proxies.
The~trust model is in between Snowflake's and uProxy's.
Buddies preferentially operate as one-hop proxies, as in uProxy,
but are not limited to proxying only for trusted friends.
To~deter misuse, buddies specify a policy of
what categories of content they are willing to proxy.
The buddy software is
not constrained by a web browser environment,
and can, like uProxy, use protocol obfuscation
on the client--buddy link.
% V-D: "We also implement traffic obfuscation to protect MassBrowser's traffic
% against traffic analysis attacks. Particularly, we have built a custom
% implementation of the obfsproxy Tor pluggable transport tailored to work with
% our MassBrowser implementation."
% VI-A: "MassBrowser uses a custom protocol over TCP/UDP for the communications
% between Clients and Buddies."

Other circumvention systems have used WebRTC,
though without Snowflake's focus on numerous proxies.
Protozoa~\cite{Barradas2020a}
% reading group summary of Protozoa https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/55
and Stegozoa~\cite{Figueira2022a}
demonstrate point-to-point covert tunnel over WebRTC,
the former by directly replacing encoded media
with its own ciphertexts,
the latter using video steganography.
Significantly, where Snowflake now uses WebRTC data channels,
Protozoa and Stegozoa use WebRTC media streams,
which may have advantages for blocking resistance.
We will say more on this point in \autoref{sec:fingerprinting}.
TorKameleon~\cite{Vilalonga2023a} is a WebRTC-based system
with the dual goals of resisting blocking
and complicating traffic correlation attacks.
It~uses a recent draft programming interface called
WebRTC Encoded Transforms
% "Editor's Draft" status as of 2023-12-12 https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-encoded-transform/
% https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Using_Encoded_Transforms
to support Protozoa-like
embedding of data within media streams,
without invasive browser modifications.
% Examples of Encoded Transforms in TorKameleon source code:

% Very early versions of Lantern (circa 2014) used social network–based trusted proxies:

%   https://web.archive.org/web/2oe_/http://wayback-fakeurl.archive.org/yt/aiPkCugE-RY
% But it wasn't WebRTC, so was less like Snowflake than uProxy was.
% I'll draw the line here, since even Tor bridges are "volunteer-operated" in a sense.

Our goal in this paper is to provide a realistic assessment of Snowflake,
neither to exaggerate its advantages,
nor disproportionately emphasize the limitations
of other systems.
Circumvention research is a cooperative enterprise,
and we recognize and support our colleagues who
design and maintain their own systems.
With Snowflake, we have tried to explore a different point in the design space,
and by this exploration widen the scope of effective circumvention techniques.
We~acknowledge that Snowflake will be a better choice in some
censorship environments and
worse in others; indeed,
one of the ideas we hope to convey
is that blocking resistance
can be meaningfully understood only in relation to particular censor
and its resources, costs, and motivations.

\section{How it works}
\label{sec:mechanics}

\begin{figure*}[t]
\includegraphics{figures/architecture/architecture.jpg}
\caption{
Architecture of Snowflake.
The client contacts the broker through a special rendezvous channel with high blocking resistance.
The broker matches the client with one of the proxies that are currently polling.
The client and proxy connect to one another using WebRTC.
The proxy connects to the bridge,
then begins copying traffic in both directions.
If~the proxy disappears,
the client does another rendezvous
and resumes its session with a new proxy.
}
\label{fig:architecture}
\todo[inline]{Make this graphic depict STUN servers and indirect rendezvous.}
\end{figure*}

A~Snowflake proxy connection proceeds in three phases.
First, there is rendezvous, in which a client
indicates its need for circumvention service
and is matched with a temporary proxy.
Rendezvous is facilitated by a central server called the broker.
Then, there is connection establishment,
where the client and its proxy connect to each other
with WebRTC, using information exchanged during rendezvous.
Finally, there is data transfer,
where the proxy transports data
between the client and the bridge.
The bridge is responsible for directing the client's traffic
to its eventual destination
(in~our case, by feeding it into the Tor network).
\autoref{fig:architecture} illustrates the process.

These phases repeat as needed, as temporary proxies come and~go.
Proxy failure is not an abnormal condition---it~happens whenever
a proxy is running in a browser that is closed, for example.
A~client builds a circumvention session over
a sequence of proxies, switching to a new one
whenever the current one stops working.
State variables stored at the client and the bridge
let the session pick up where it left off.
The change of proxies is invisible to the applications using Snowflake
(except for a brief delay for another rendezvous).
The Snowflake client presents an abstraction of one uninterrupted connection.

It~does not avail a censor to block the broker or bridge,
because Snowflake clients never contact either one directly.
Clients reach the broker over an indirect rendezvous channel.
Access to the bridge is always mediated by a temporary proxy.

\subsection{Rendezvous}
\label{sec:rendezvous}

A~session begins with the client sending a rendezvous message to the broker.
An~ambient population of proxies
constantly polls the broker to check for clients in need of service.
The broker matches the client with an available proxy,
taking into account factors like NAT compatibility.
% NAT type is currently the only constraint:
% matchSnowflake https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/blob/9edaee65470a1483bbdbe984e5e15a885f1e95d2/broker/ipc.go#L236
% But protocol versions may become a consideration in the future:
% "Analysis of speed deficiency of Snowflake in China, 2023 Q1" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/40251#note_2903271

The client's rendezvous message
% ClientPollRequest https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/blob/9edaee65470a1483bbdbe984e5e15a885f1e95d2/common/messages/client.go#L64
is a bundle of data that the broker will need in order to match the client with a proxy,
and the proxy will need in order to connect to the client.
The most important part of the rendezvous message is a
Session Description Protocol (SDP) \firstterm{offer}~\cite{rfc8839},
which contains the information needed for a WebRTC connection,
such as the client's external IP addresses
and cryptographic data to secure a later key exchange.
% Specifically, a certificate fingerprint: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8122.html#section-5
The broker gives the client's offer to a currently polling proxy,
which sends back an SDP \firstterm{answer}
with its share of connection details.
The broker forwards the proxy's answer to the client,
and client and proxy then connect to one other directly.
In~WebRTC terms, this offer/\allowbreak answer exchange is called
``signaling''~\cite[\S 2.2]{rfc8825}, and here the broker acts as a signaling server.
To~gather the information for an SDP offer or answer,
clients and proxies communicate with third-party servers,
called STUN servers,
before contacting the broker.
We~will say more about how STUN is used in \autoref{sec:connection}.
Connecting to STUN servers is a normal part of WebRTC,
though there are fingerprinting considerations
that we cover in \autoref{sec:fingerprinting}.

Interaction with the broker uses a ``long-polling'' model,
depicted abstractly in \autoref{fig:rendezvous}.
Proxies poll the broker periodically,
making an ordinary HTTPS request.
The broker holds the connection open for a few seconds
to await a client rendezvous message.
If~none arrives, the broker sends a response that says ``no clients''
and the proxy goes to sleep until its next poll.
When a client does arrive,
the broker responds to the proxy's poll request
with the client's SDP offer.
The proxy re-connects to the broker to send back its SDP answer.
The broker sends the SDP answer to the client
and an acknowledgement to the proxy.
At~this point rendezvous is finished:
client and proxy have what they need to connect.

\begin{figure}

}
\label{fig:rendezvous}
\end{figure}

Proxies are free to connect to the broker directly,
because they are assumed to be uncensored.
But clients must use an indirect,
blocking-resistant channel,
because any direct connection with the broker
would be easily blocked by a censor.
What is needed, essentially,
is a miniature circumvention system to
bootstrap the full system.
But if clients have access to a bootstrap rendezvous method
that is good enough to reach the broker,
why is a more extensive circumvention system needed at all?
The answer is that the restricted scope of rendezvous
admits a wider range of solutions than general circumvention.
Techniques that would be too slow or expensive
for high-volume or interactive circumvention
may yet be suited to rendezvous,
because rendezvous happens infrequently
and transmits only small amounts of data.

The nice thing about rendezvous that it is modular and separable.
More than one method may be used,
and the methods need not have anything in common with the main system.
Anything that can be persuaded to convey a message
of about 1,500 bytes indirectly to the broker,
and return a response of about the same size,
may work as a Snowflake rendezvous module.

Snowflake now supports three rendezvous methods:

\begin{description}
\item[Domain fronting]
In~this method, the client does an HTTPS exchange with the broker
through an intermediary web service such as a content delivery network (CDN),
setting the externally visible hostname
(the TLS Server Name Indication, or SNI~\cite[\S 3]{rfc6066})
to a ``front domain'' different from the broker's.
The CDN routes the HTTPS request to the broker according to the
the HTTP Host header, which, under TLS encryption,
reflects the actual hostname of the broker~\cite{Fifield2015a}.
A~censor cannot easily block domain-fronted rendezvous
without also blocking unrelated connections to the front domain,
which should be selected to have high value to the censor.
The well-known drawback of domain fronting
is the high cost of CDN bandwidth,
but this is not a big problem
when it is used only for rendezvous.

\item[AMP cache]
AMP is a framework for web pages written in a restricted dialect of HTML.
Part of the framework is a free-to-use
cache server~\cite{amp-cache}.
The cache fetches AMP-conformant pages on demand,
making it effectively a restricted sort of HTTP proxy.
We~have a module that encodes rendezvous messages to conform to AMP requirements,
allowing them to be exchanged with the broker via the AMP cache.\urlfootnote{
% "AMP cache rendezvous"
https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/merge_requests/50
}
This rendezvous method is not easily blocked
without blocking the cache server as a whole.
It~still technically requires domain fronting,
because the AMP cache protocol normally exposes the
broker's hostname in the TLS SNI,
but it enlarges the set of usable intermediaries and front domains.

\item[SQS (Simple Queue Service)]
Amazon SQS is a message queuing service designed for
communication between microservices.
Snowflake has the ability
(new at the time of this writing)
to use a message queue as a one-way communication channel.\urlfootnote{
https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/merge_requests/214
}
Clients write into a public queue, and the broker reads from~it.
Rendezvous response messages are sent back through
dynamically created, single-use queues.
Communication is indirect via SQS servers.
\end{description}

Rendezvous is not unique to Snowflake.
Other examples of rendezvous are
the DEFIANCE Rendezvous Protocol~\cite[\S 3]{Lincoln2012a},
the facilitator interaction in flash proxy~\cite[\S 3]{Fifield2012a},
and the registration proxy in Conjure~\cite[\S 4.1]{Frolov2019b}.
A~key property of Snowflake and the mentioned systems
is that their blocking resistance does not rely on preshared secret information.
Whatever information is needed to establish a circumvention session
is obtained dynamically at runtime.
This is in contrast to other systems in which,
before making a connection,
the client must acquire some secret,
such as an IP address or password,
through an out-of-band channel---and
blocking resistance depends on
keeping that information secret.
A~corollary of the no-secret-information property
is that an adversary is
at no special disadvantage in attacking the system.
There is no out-of-band channel which real clients have access to
but the censor does not.
The censor may pose as a client,
download the software,
study its network connections---and
the system must maintain its blocking resistance despite this.
The disadvantage of a separate rendezvous step
is that it is one more thing to get right.
Both the main circumvention channel
and the rendezvous must resist blocking:
the combination is only as strong as the weaker of the~two.

\subsection{Peer-to-peer connection establishment}
\label{sec:connection}

After rendezvous,
the client and its assigned proxy connect to one another directly.
Even in the absence of censorship,
making a connection between two Internet peers is not trivial,
because of possible interference by NAT (network address translation) and firewalls.
Snowflake clients and proxies run in diverse networks
with varying NATs and ingress policies.
Fortunately for us,
WebRTC is designed with this use case in mind.
It~has built-in support for NAT traversal in the form of
ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment)~\cite{rfc8445},
a procedure for testing combinations of peer addresses
until finding one that works.
ICE~uses third-party
STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) servers~\cite{rfc8489}
that, among other services,
let a host discover its own external IP addresses.
The first part of ICE took place at the beginning of rendezvous,
when the client and proxy contacted STUN servers to gather
external address candidates and included them in their respective
SDP offer and answer.
After rendezvous,
the peers try pairs of candidate addresses
until they are able to establish a connection.

There is no guarantee that two hosts will be able to
connect using the facilities of STUN alone.
Some combinations of address mapping and
filtering are simply incompatible.
In~such a case,
ICE would normally fall back to relaying traffic through a
TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) server~\cite{rfc8656},
a~kind of UDP proxy.
A~fallback to TURN would be problematic for Snowflake,
because the TURN servers themselves
would become a target of blocking by the censor.
% "Configure TURN servers for the proxy and/or client" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/25596
% https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8445#section-5.1.1.2
% "...use of STUN and TURN servers may be unnecessary in certain networks and use of TURN servers may be expensive, so some deployments may elect not to use them."
But Snowflake has an advantage:
most WebRTC applications want to connect \emph{a particular} pair of peers,
whereas we are happy to connect a client to \emph{any} proxy.
Snowflake clients and proxies self-assess their NAT type
and report it to the broker,
which avoids making matches
that would require TURN.

}
\label{tab:nat-matching}
\end{table}

\autoref{tab:nat-matching}
shows the compatibility of NAT variations.
A~NAT variation is defined by its combination
of address mapping and filtering behaviors~\cite[\S 3]{rfc5780}.
% RFC 4787 "Address and Port Mapping" https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4787#section-4.1
% would be the best citation for this, but it would require an additional bib entry.
Endpoint-dependent mapping
means that the address a local endpoint is translated to depends on
the remote endpoint's IP address (and possibly port).
Endpoint-dependent filtering
means that incoming packets from a remote endpoint are
allowed only if outgoing packets have already been sent to that endpoint.
As~the incompatible cases always involve endpoint-dependent address mapping
(sometimes called symmetric NAT),
we further categorize the variations into the two types
\firstterm{unrestricted} (works with most other NATs) and
\firstterm{restricted} (works only with more permissive NATs).
Unrestricted proxies may be matched with any client;
restricted proxies may be matched only with unrestricted clients.
The broker prefers to match unrestricted clients with restricted proxies,
% https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/blob/9edaee65470a1483bbdbe984e5e15a885f1e95d2/broker/ipc.go#L236
in~order to conserve unrestricted proxies
for the clients that need them.
Endpoint-dependent mapping is always considered restricted,
but the type of NATs with address and port-dependent filtering differs
depending on the peer:
for proxies it is restricted, but
for clients it is unrestricted.
This is a heuristic
to conserve unrestricted proxies
for clients with endpoint-dependent NAT mapping.
Though it creates the potential for an incompatible match
between a client with an address and port-dependent filter and a
proxy with endpoint-dependent mapping,
% https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/wikis/NAT-matching?version_id=dd1f328e2c9570eb252c43a053bdec0314c73345#fn-1-6791
this case is rare in practice,
and in the event it happens,
a~client can re-rendezvous and try again.

Clients use the NAT behavior discovery feature~\cite{rfc5780} of STUN
to self-assess their NAT type.
% "Use STUN to determine NAT behaviour of peers" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/34129
% "Add utility to help user discover their NAT type" https://github.com/pion/stun/issues/8
Proxies cannot use the same technique,
because the necessary STUN features are not exposed
to JavaScript.
For them,
we adapt a technique from MassBrowser~\cite[\S \mbox{V-A}]{Nasr2020a}
and run a centralized, always-on WebRTC testing peer
behind a simulated NAT with endpoint-dependent mapping.\urlfootnote{
% "Have a remote probe service to test snowflake proxy NAT compatability"
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/40013
}
If~a proxy can connect to the testing peer,
its type is unrestricted;
otherwise it is restricted.
% Clients and proxies retest their NAT type periodically,
% to account for potential changes in their local networking environment.
If~a client or proxy is unable to determine its NAT type,
it~reports the type ``unknown,''
which the broker conservatively treats as restricted.

Unrestricted proxies are
a relatively small fraction of the proxy population,
as \autoref{fig:proxy-nat-type} shows.
In~absolute number, though, there are enough
for restricted clients at current levels of use.
The broker counts the number of matched \((M)\)
and unmatched \((U)\) client rendezvous requests per day.
If~we assume that clients attempt rendezvous repeatedly until getting a match,
then the number of attempts per success is \((U + M) / M\).
Under this assumption, as~of February 2024,
the average client needs 1.01 rendezvous attempts
to find a compatible proxy.

As~the proxy negotiates the WebRTC connection with its client,
% "At the same time": https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/40228
it~also connects to the bridge using WebSocket~\cite{rfc6455}.
Unlike the client connection, the bridge connection
presents no challenges:
it's just HTTPS to an open port on a server.
The choice of WebSocket for this link is arbitrary,
and another protocol might be substituted in its place.
It~does not need to be blocking-resistant
(because we are already outside the censor's zone of control),
it~only needs to be available to JavaScript code in web browsers.

\subsection{Data transfer}
\label{sec:data-transfer}

No~complicated processing takes place at the proxy.
The main value of a Snowflake proxy is its IP address:
it~gives the client a peer to connect to that is not on the censor's address blocklist.
Having provided that,
the proxy assumes a role of data transfer,
copying data upstream from client to bridge
and downstream from bridge to client.

Snowflake uses a stack of nested protocol layers.
\autoref{fig:protocol-layers}
shows the stack for the link between the client and the proxy.
This is the link that uses WebRTC,
and the one that is exposed to the censor.
The stack for the proxy--bridge link is the same,
but with WebSocket replacing
WebRTC in the outermost layer.
Layers at the top of the diagram are ``outer,'' closer to the network;
ones at the bottom are ``inner,'' closer to the user.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l@{\,}l@{}l@{\,}l}

\multicolumn{4}{l}{application streams} \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{
The protocol stack for the client--proxy link.
}
\label{fig:protocol-layers}
\end{figure}

Each layer serves a different purpose.
The layers marked ``ephemeral'' are replaced
at every proxy switchover.
These outer layers form the ``carrier''
over which the more stateful inner layers are transported.
The layers marked ``persistent'' are instantiated just once
per circumvention session and outlive any single proxy.
They maintain end-to-end state
and present an abstraction of a single long-lived tunnel.
This virtual tunnel then transports user application traffic
such as web browsing and messaging.

The point-to-point link between a client and its proxy is
a WebRTC data channel~\cite{rfc8831}.
Data channels let two WebRTC peers
exchange arbitrary binary messages.
A~data channel is itself a composition of three protocol layers:
UDP for network transport,
DTLS (Datagram TLS)
for confidentiality and integrity, and
SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)
for delimiting message boundaries
and other features like congestion control.
The peers authenticate each other
at the DTLS layer using certificate fingerprints
that were exchanged during rendezvous~\cite[\S 5.1]{rfc8842}.

Data channels are well-suited to the circumvention use case.
But data channels are not the only option
in WebRTC for data transport:
there are also \firstterm{media streams},
meant for real-time audio and video.
Which of these options is used is an externally observable feature,
and may therefore become a fingerprinting vector.
We~will consider this topic further in \autoref{sec:fingerprinting}.

% Not going to get into how we currently use reliable, ordered (TCP-like) data
% channels, but plan to switch to unreliable, unordered (UDP-like) data
% channels, a better fit for the underlying datagram-oriented Turbo Tunnel
% layer.
%
% "turn off reliable mode for WebRTC DataChannel" https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/merge_requests/109
% "Snowflake is currently using network resource in a so suboptimal way..." https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/40251#note_2891751

A~proxy maintains two connections for each client it is currently serving:
one WebRTC connection to the client and one WebSocket connection to the bridge.
Data received from the client over WebRTC
is copied to the bridge over WebSocket,
and vice versa.
Although this pair of connections
effectively connects the client to the bridge,
it~alone is not enough for usable circumvention.
This is because Snowflake proxies do not last forever.
When a proxy goes away,
its WebRTC and WebSocket connections go with~it.
Without additional consideration,
the loss of a proxy would mean the end
of a client's circumvention session.
What is needed is a separate notion of session state
that is independent of the currently used proxy
and its data channel.

We~adopt the
Turbo Tunnel design pattern~\cite{Fifield2020a}
and insert a userspace
session and reliability protocol
between the ephemeral ``carrier'' protocols
and the client's own application streams.\urlfootnote{
% "[anti-censorship-team] Turbo Tunnel in Snowflake"
https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/anti-censorship-team/2020-February/000059.html
}
It~attaches sequence and acknowledgement numbers
to the pieces of data that pass through the tunnel.
After a temporary break in proxy connectivity,
the client and bridge retransmit whatever data has not been acknowledged
by the other side,
then carry on as normal,
with no duplication or loss of data.
How this works, concretely,
is~the client chooses a random session identifier string
at the beginning of its session,
and sends it as a preamble each time it
connects to a new proxy.
When the bridge accepts a new WebSocket connection,
it~inspects the preamble to find the client's session identifier string,
and uses it to index a table of session state information.
If~the session does not yet exist,
the bridge creates~one;
otherwise it resumes an existing session
(starting by retransmitting unacknowledged data).
If~a client's proxy disappears
while in the middle of a long download,
there may be a pause while Snowflake
does another rendezvous and acquires a fresh proxy,
but after that the download will continue uninterrupted.

For the inner session layer we use a combination of
KCP~\cite{kcp} and
smux~\cite{smux}.
KCP provides reliability and retransmission,
and smux detects and terminates timed-out streams.
Other userspace protocols, for example QUIC or TCP,
could be used more or less equivalently
as the inner session layer.
We~prototyped successfully with both QUIC and KCP/\allowbreak smux
before settling on the latter.
The main criteria influencing our decision
were familiarity and ease of maintenance.

One more protocol layer is needed
before sending user application data through the tunnel:
an~end-to-end secure channel between the client and the bridge,
using keys unknown to the proxy.
The inner session layer does not provide security,
and the DTLS of the data channel is only hop-by-hop,
not end-to-end.
The purpose of this additional secure channel is
to prevent proxies from inspecting or tampering with the traffic
they carry.
Nothing special is needed here; for example,
TLS or a VPN protocol
would work fine.
Our deployment uses the Tor protocol as this secure channel:
after removing the WebSocket and Turbo Tunnel layers,
the bridge feeds the data it receives into a local Tor bridge,
which routes the stream into the Tor network
and eventually to its destination.
Tor, of course, has additional privacy advantages
that are not, strictly speaking, required for circumvention,
but are nevertheless nice to have,
such as that not even the Snowflake bridge
is trusted to know the contents or destinations of client streams.
But Tor also has some drawbacks,
which we will comment on in
\autoref{sec:multi-bridge}
and
\autoref{sec:future}.

Snowflake may be seen as an instance of the
``untrusted messengers'' model of Feamster et~al.~\cite[\S 3]{Feamster2003a}.
Their \firstterm{messengers} correspond to our \firstterm{proxies};
their \firstterm{portal} is our \firstterm{bridge}.
Proxies are trusted to deliver the client's client's traffic to the bridge,
but do not themselves connect to the destination, or~even know what it~is.
An~inner layer of cryptography protects the client's traffic
from observation and manipulation by malicious proxies.
The protection goes in the other direction as well:
because proxies are programmed to connect only to a Snowflake bridge,
and they never process anything but ciphertext,
a~malicious client cannot cause a proxy to misbehave
or have the client's actions attributed to~it.
Without this mutual guarantee of safety,
it~would be too risky to associate a client and proxy
who have no preexisting trust relationship.

\section{Protocol fingerprinting}
\label{sec:fingerprinting}

% https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/wikis/Fingerprinting

Snowflake's main focus is the ``address blocking'' side of circumvention,
but the ``content blocking'' side matters too.
The goal, as~always, is to make circumvention traffic
hard to distinguish from traffic the censor cares not to block.
Design decisions in Snowflake---the use of WebRTC,
and the requirement to run proxies in browsers---mean
that Snowflake can, at~best, only blend in with other WebRTC traffic.
But even within that scope,
there are variations in \emph{how}
WebRTC is implemented and used,
which, if~not carefully considered, might enable a censor
to selectively block only Snowflake,
leaving other uses of WebRTC undisturbed.
Unfortunately for the circumvention developer,
the richness of WebRTC protocols
creates a large attack surface for fingerprinting.

The most prevalent implementations of WebRTC are those in web browsers.
Snowflake originally used a WebRTC library extracted from Chromium\urlfootnote{
https://github.com/keroserene/go-webrtc
},
but that proved to be difficult to maintain
and build for multiple platforms.
Since~2019, Snowflake uses the Pion~\cite{pion-webrtc},
implementation of WebRTC.\urlfootnote{
% "Evaluate pion WebRTC"
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/28942
}
It~is not tied to a browser,
which is both good and bad.
The good is less development friction,
better memory safety
(Pion is written in Go, Chromium WebRTC in C++),
and a working relationship with the developers
to have fingerprinting changes made when needed.
The bad is that its protocol fingerprints
do not automatically match those of the mostly browser-originated
WebRTC that Snowflake aims to blend in with.

The following is a list of the main fingerprinting concerns in Snowflake and
what we have done to address them.
A~fingerprinting vulnerability
does not automatically disqualify a circumvention system:
it~depends on whether it can be fixed
without changing the basic nature of the system.
The important thing is to have solid fundamentals;
minor flaws may be patched up as needed.

\begin{description}
\item[Selection of STUN servers]
The use of STUN with WebRTC is common,
but the choice of what STUN servers to use is up to the application.
Running dedicated STUN servers for Snowflake would not work,
because a censor would experience no collateral harm in
blocking them.
Our deployment uses a pool of public STUN servers
that are used for purposes other than circumvention.
The client chooses a random subset
for each new session.
% I thought about using stun.l.google.com as an example here.
% As of 2024-01-31, stun.l.google.com seems to work in China.
% It was DNS-blocked on 2022-10-01, but must have been unblocked since.
% https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/128#issuecomment-1920113565

\item[Format of STUN messages]
STUN is most often deployed over plaintext UDP,
which leaves the contents of messages open to inspection.
STUN messages consist of a fixed header
followed by a list of
attributes~\cite[\S 5]{rfc8489}.
What attributes appear,
and their order,
depends on the STUN implementation
and how the application uses it.

We have not done anything particular
to disguise STUN messages.
Though UDP is the most common,
STUN specifies other transports,
including encrypted ones like DTLS.
The alternative transports may be options for Snowflake in the future---of~course,
only if they are commonly used enough not to
stick out in themselves.
% "Investigate if STUN over TCP/TLS is beneficial to us" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/40240

\item[Rendezvous]
Because the rendezvous methods of
\autoref{sec:rendezvous}
are modular,
each one needs a separate justification
as to why it should be difficult to block.
They must also be implemented in a way
that does not expose accidental distinguishers.
The domain fronting, AMP cache, and SQS rendezvous methods
use HTTPS,
which is TLS,
which means TLS fingerprinting is a concern~\cite[\S 5.1]{Fifield2015a}.

Snowflake, like many circumvention systems,
uses the uTLS package~\cite[\S VII]{Frolov2019a}
to get a client TLS fingerprint that is randomized or that imitates common browsers.
\autoref{sec:block-ir} has an account of when
domain fronting rendezvous was briefly blocked in Iran,
because we were slow in activating uTLS.

\item[DTLS]
The outermost layer of a WebRTC data connection,
directly exposed to a censor,
is~DTLS over UDP.
DTLS is an adaptation of TLS~\cite[\S 1]{rfc9147} to the datagram setting,
and therefore has the fingerprinting concerns of TLS~\cite{Frolov2019a}.

Owing to practical considerations,
Snowflake's defenses to DTLS fingerprinting are not very robust,
and are reactive rather than proactive.
In~the realm of TLS one may use uTLS,
but there is as yet no equivalent for DTLS.
The present way of altering DTLS fingerprints in Snowflake
is to submit a patch to Pion
when a feature used for fingerprinting is identified.
\autoref{sec:block-ru} documents how this has happened twice,
in response to blocking in Russia.

\item[Data channel or media stream]
Along with data channels, WebRTC offers \firstterm{media streams},
which transmit encoded audio and video.
Though both data channels and media streams are encrypted,
they are externally distinguishable
because they use different encryption containers.
Data channels use DTLS,
while media streams use DTLS-SRTP;
that is, the Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol
with a DTLS key exchange~\cite[\S 4.3]{rfc8827}.

Data channels are a closer match to Snowflake's communication model:
media streams are meant for audio and video,
not arbitrary binary messages.
But the use of data channels could become
a fingerprinting feature if other WebRTC applications mainly use media streams.
Should it become necessary,
it~would likely be possible to adapt Snowflake's WebRTC connections
to use media streams rather than data channels,
either by modulating data into an
audio or video signal in the manner~of, say,
Stegozoa~\cite[\S 3.3]{Figueira2022a},
or by replacing the encoded data inside SRTP packets,
as in Protozoa~\cite[\S 4.4]{Barradas2020a}
or TorKameleon~\cite[\S \mbox{III-D}]{Vilalonga2023a}.

\end{description}

Most research on detecting Snowflake to date
has focused on protocol fingerprinting.
Fifield and Gil Epner~\cite{arxiv.1605.08805}
studied the network traffic of WebRTC applications
with the goal of finding fingerprinting pitfalls.
Frolov et~al.~\cite[\S \mbox{V-C}]{Frolov2019a}
observed that the undisguised TLS fingerprint
of Snowflake's domain fronting rendezvous was distinctive,
and introduced the uTLS package that Snowflake
now uses to protect~it.

MacMillan et~al.~\cite{arxiv.2008.03254}
focused on the DTLS handshake,
comparing Snowflake to three other WebRTC applications.
They correctly anticipated features
of the Pion DTLS handshake
that would later be used
to block Snowflake in Russia;
see details in \autoref{sec:block-ru}.
Holland et~al.~\cite[\S 5.3]{Holland2021a},
using the bits of UDP datagrams directly as features,
demonstrated approximately equal performance
on the same DTLS handshake data set.
Their automatically derived classifier assigned high feature importance
to packet length fields,
in~fact doing well even without DTLS payload features.

Chen et~al.~\cite{Chen2023a}
combined features
of rendezvous and DTLS
in order to reduce false positives.
Their classifier begins
by looking for DNS queries for
STUN servers and front domains commonly used by Snowflake clients.
They then apply a machine learning classifier
to features of a subsequent DTLS handshake.
The authors acknowledge that DTLS fingerprinting
is fragile, as~the DTLS features are, in~principle,
controllable by the application.
The DNS prefilter may perhaps be mitigated
by alternative rendezvous methods (\autoref{sec:rendezvous}),
or~by smarter selection of STUN servers.

Xie et~al.~\cite{Xie2023a} trained a decision tree to
distinguish domain fronting rendezvous
from certain other HTTPS exchanges,
using
packet size, direction, latency, and bandwidth features.
Wails et~al.~\cite{Wails2024a}
criticize past research on detecting circumvention systems,
saying that accuracy claims do not hold up
in light of the low base rates of circumvention traffic in practice.
% IV-D: "Despite the prima facie acceptable performance of these
% classifiers ... we argue that these results *do not* accurately
% reflect a censor's ability to detect obfs4 under realistic conditions."
They developed classifiers
for Snowflake and other circumvention protocols
that improved on the state of the art,
but found them still to prohibitively imprecise at realistic base rates.
% V-C: "While it is the case that deep learning improves performance,
% the false positive rates are still prohibitively high to scale to
% realistic base rates. Fig. 5 plots Prec^λ as a function of the base
% rate λ. For more realistic base rates, such as λ > 1 × 10^6, the
% precision attained by any of the classifiers is near-zero."
They propose reducing false positives by combining
multiple observations per IP address---classifying hosts,
not flows---and suggest that Snowflake's lack of
fixed proxies mitigates against this enhancement.
% VII: "One way to mitigate the effects of host-based analysis is to
% design circumvention systems to use multiple ephemeral bridges
% over time rather than a few long-term static bridges, similar
% the design of Snowflake."

Related to protocol fingerprinting is \firstterm{traffic analysis}:
classifying connections based on features like
packet lengths and transmission times---which
may be different in a circumvention system
that in other uses of the cover protocol.
The best classifiers of Xie et~al.\ and Wails et~al.\ were of this nature.
While traffic analysis attacks are worth thinking about,
we~caution that academic audiences
have historically overestimated their importance.
Tschantz et~al.~\cite[\S VII]{Tschantz2016a} observed
that censors are sensitive to costs
and---particularly---false positives.
They claim (and our experience bears it out)
that censors prefer traffic classification rules
that are simple, precise, and deterministic,
and avoid ones that
require managing state,
are computationally expensive,
or~have non-negligible false positive rates---like
those based in traffic analysis.
% Traffic analysis attacks are hardly worth considering
% until after taking care of the fundamentals
% of endpoint and content blocking,
% and even then, there is, as~yet, little evidence of their being used.
Nevertheless, we~have tried to future-proof Snowflake in this regard:
the protocol inside the WebRTC data channel supports
shaping of transmission sizes and timing,
which ought to be sufficient to imitate the traffic fingerprint
of other WebRTC applications.

But the feature is currently unused.

\section{Experience}
\label{sec:experience}

Snowflake has now been in operation for a few years.
In~lieu of a forward-looking evaluation,
here we take a look back
at the history of its deployment
and reflect on the experience.
Fielding a new circumvention system offers
and opportunity to study experimentally
its uptake and performance.
In~this section we cover
the number of clients over time and the bandwidth they use,
the size and composition of the proxy pool,
the variability of proxy IP addresses,
and engineering considerations related to scaling.
We~take up the topic of reactions by censors
in \autoref{sec:block}.

As~a consequence of our use of a Tor bridge
as the backend for the Snowflake bridge,
we~can estimate client counts and bandwidth using
the privacy-preserving
techniques of Tor Metrics~\cite{tor-reproducible-metrics}.
Tor bridges publish daily summaries of statistics,
including client counts and bandwidth,
as~well as the distribution of client countries
inferred from a local geolocation database.
\autoref{fig:client-counts} shows the number of clients
and the amount of bandwidth consumed since 2021.
The upper graph does not count unique clients,
but rather the \emph{average number of concurrent clients} per day.
% "The result is an average number of concurrent users, estimated from data collected over a day. We can't say how many distinct users there are."
% https://metrics.torproject.org/reproducible-metrics.html#users
% $ grep '^2022-02-04.*,snowflake,' figures/users/userstats-bridge-transport-multi.csv
% 2022-02-04,5481936581E23D2D178105D44DB6915AB06BFB7F,snowflake,10124.23,4.00,4.00
For example, the fact that the graph passes through 10,000 on \mbox{2022-02-04}
means that there were, on~average, 10,000 clients using Snowflake
at a given time on that day.
The number of users is estimated by counting the ``directory requests''
that Tor clients make periodically.
The contribution of a client session depends on its duration,
not on how many temporary proxies it used;
a~client connected for two hours counts half as much
as one connected for four hours.
Bandwidth is computed as the
average of incoming and outgoing bytes
(which are approximately equal anyway),
after subtracting
bytes spent processing directory requests
(which are less than 1\% of total bandwidth).

Snowflake shipped in the alpha release series of Tor Browser
for years before entering the stable series.
The first releases were
for GNU/Linux
in Tor Browser~7.0a1 on \mbox{2017-01-24}\,\urlfootnote{
% "Add snowflake pt to alpha linux builds"
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/20735
% "First working bundles with Snowflake, for linux only" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/19001
}
and for macOS
in Tor Browser~7.5a4 on \mbox{2017-08-08}\,\urlfootnote{
% "Merge Snowflake for mac"
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/22831
% "mac reproducible build" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/19001
% "[tbb-dev] Please check reproducibility of mac build with Snowflake (e084e83418)" https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tbb-dev/2017-July/000579.html
}.
It~was at this point we encountered difficulties with
the Chromium-derived WebRTC library we had been using
that prevented us from preparing releases for other platforms.
We~were able to resume making progress after switching to
Pion WebRTC~\cite{pion-webrtc} in~2019.
Snowflake for Windows was released
in Tor Browser~9.0a7 on \mbox{2019-10-01}\,\urlfootnote{
% "Windows reproducible build of snowflake"
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/25483
},
and for Android in
Tor Browser~10.0a1 on \mbox{2020-06-02}\,\urlfootnote{
% "Integrate snowflake into mobile Tor Browser alpha"
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/30318
% "Android reproducible build of Snowflake" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/28672
}.

While Snowflake was then available
on every platform supported by Tor Browser,
it~was not yet comfortably usable.
Two important parts were missing:
a~lack of NAT type matching (\autoref{sec:connection})
meant that a client could not always connect to its assigned proxy;
and no persistent session state (\autoref{sec:data-transfer})
meant that even if a proxy connection were successful,
the client's session would end once their first proxy disappeared.
By~early 2020,
the number of concurrent users
had not risen above~40.

}.
With these changes, Snowflake became practical to use for daily browsing,
and the number of clients began to grow into~2021.

Snowflake's growth began in earnest
when it became part of default installations.
Orbot, a mobile app that provides a VPN-like Tor proxy,
added a Snowflake client in version 16.4.0
on \mbox{2021-01-12}.\urlfootnote{

}
Snowflake graduated to Tor Browser's stable series
in Tor Browser~10.5
on \mbox{2021-07-06}\,\urlfootnote{
https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-105
},
becoming a third built-in circumvention option
alongside meek and obfs4.
This is the first event marked in \autoref{fig:client-counts}.
% https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser-build/-/blob/tbb-10.5-build1/projects/tor-browser/Bundle-Data/PTConfigs/bridge_prefs.js
Being in the stable release series meant it was
easily available to all Tor users,
not only a self-selected group of alpha testers.
The number of clients increased steadily
over the next five months,
reaching almost 2,000 by December~2021.

Censorship events may have the contrary effects
of decreasing or increasing usage
of a circumvention system.
Usage decreases
when the system itself succumbs to blocking;
but increases when only other, less robust
systems are blocked,
which has the effect of concentrating users
onto the reduced number of systems that remain working.
Two censorship events,
one in Russia and one in Iran,
resulted in great increases in the number of Snowflake users.

On \mbox{2021-12-01}, some ISPs in Russia
instituted measures to block
most ways of accessing Tor,
including Snowflake~\cite{ooni-2021-russia-blocks-tor}.
The measures varied in their effectiveness;
in~the case of Snowflake,
blocking was triggered by a feature of the DTLS handshake,
which we were able to mitigate in new releases within a few weeks.\urlfootnote{

Over the next two months, the number of clients quadrupled;
by~May 2022,
about 70\% of Snowflake users were in Russia.

The client count in Russia got an additional small boost
starting on \mbox{2022-07-14},
when Tor Browser~11.5 added a feature
to automatically enable circumvention options when needed.\urlfootnote{

In~reaction to protests that began on \mbox{2022-09-16}
after the death of Mahsa Amini,
the government of Iran imposed network shutdowns
and additional blocking,
severe even by the standards of a country already notorious
for censorship~\cite{ooni-2022-iran-blocks-social-media-mahsa-amini-protests}.
Users turned to the circumvention systems
that continued working despite the new restrictions,
Snowflake among them.
Adoption was rapid:
on~\mbox{2022-09-20}, Iran accounted for 1\% of Snowflake users;
by \mbox{2022-09-24} it was~67\%.

The sudden influx of users had us scrambling for a few days
to implement performance improvements.
Two weeks later, on \mbox{2022-10-04},
usage dropped almost as quickly as it had risen---the
cause was the blocking, in~Iran, of~a TLS fingerprint
used by the Snowflake client.\urlfootnote{
% "Sudden reduction in snowflake-01 bridge bandwidth, 2022-10-04 17:15"
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/40207
}
After we released fixes for the TLS fingerprinting issue,
the client count began to recover.
But in our haste to deploy performance optimizations in September,
we~inadvertently introduced a bug that actually harmed performance,
becoming more severe at higher client counts.\urlfootnote{
% "Weird KCP packets received by the client"
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/40260
}
This dragged the count down again,
until we fixed the bug in mid-March 2023.
(Umayya et~al.\ happened to be doing performance tests of Snowflake
and other circumvention systems
at this time~\cite[\S 4.6]{Umayya2023a}---their results
independently confirm the reduced reliability of Snowflake
before the performance bug was fixed.\urlfootnote{
% "Deploy snowflake-server for QueuePacketConn buffer reuse fix (#40260)"
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/40262
})
We~will say more about Iran
in \autoref{sec:block-ir}.

For most of this history,
the Snowflake bridge was a single server,
which we upgraded and optimized as needed.
As~the bridge reached its hardware capacity,
and performance improvements got harder to achieve,
we~deployed a second bridge to share the load.
The challenges and design considerations of doing so are discussed in \autoref{sec:multi-bridge}.
The new bridge was made available in
Tor Browser~12.0 on \mbox{2022-12-07}.
By~July, it~had taken on
18\% of users and
20\% of bandwidth.

The drop in users on \mbox{2023-09-20}
was not caused by any censor action;
rather, it~was an unexpected change in the cloud
infrastructure we used for domain fronting rendezvous.
The front domain we had been using
changed its hosting to a different CDN,
which caused client rendezvous messages to fail to reach the broker.\urlfootnote{

}
We~made releases
with alternative front domains\urlfootnote{

but it took time for users to adjust.

As~of \mbox{2024-02-01},
Snowflake had transferred a lifetime total of 13.9~PB of circumvention data.

\subsection{Number and type of proxies}
\label{sec:proxies}

Snowflake's effectiveness depends on its proxies,
of~which there are several types.
The primary type is the web browser extension,
% "Creating a Snowflake WebExtension addon" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/23888
which runs in the background in volunteers' browser
and quietly serves clients.
There is ``web badge'' version of the proxy that does not require installation.
It~uses the same JavaScript code as the extension, but runs in an ordinary web page.
Some people leave a browser tab idling on the web badge,
rather than installing a browser extension.
There is also a command-line implementation of the proxy
that does not require a browser.
% "Golang implementation of standalone snowflake proxy" https://github.com/keroserene/snowflake/pull/41
This version is convenient to install on a rented VPS, for example.
Long-term proxies running at fixed IP addresses
are somewhat at odds with Snowflake's goal of proxy address diversity,
but these standalone proxies are valuable because
they tend to have less restrictive NATs,
making them compatible with more clients.
Finally, Orbot,
as~well as being able to \emph{use} Snowflake for circumvention,
can also \emph{provide} Snowflake proxy service to others,
a~feature called ``kindness mode.''
% Only so called in Orbot v17+, which should be current by the time the paper is submitted.

We worked with the Tor Project's network health team to collect privacy-preserving metrics
of client and proxy rendezvous interactions at the broker,
and publish them in the same way as the bridge metrics of \autoref{sec:clients}.\urlfootnote{
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/network-health/metrics/collector/29461
}
The metrics represent counts of proxy types,
unique proxy IP addresses and geolocated country codes,
NAT types (\autoref{sec:connection}), and
success rates of matching clients with proxies.
Aggregate metrics
are published at 24-hour intervals.\urlfootnote{
https://metrics.torproject.org/collector.html\#snowflake-stats
}
The broker does not record nor publish the IP addresses
of clients or proxies.
Metrics concerning client polls are rounded to multiples of~8,
in~accordance with established Tor Metrics practice.

of running a Snowflake proxy versus a Tor bridge---though
the comparison is not quite direct,
because Tor bridges have better defenses
against enumeration than do Snowflake proxies.

that it would even be possible to attract
enough proxies to support a reasonable number of users

the idea being that people's browsers
would automatically become proxies

unless they checked an option to prevent~it.

\subsection{Proxy churn}
\label{sec:proxy-churn}

% https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/34075
% https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/merge_requests/95

The size of the proxy pool is not the only measure of its quality.
Also important is its ``churn,'' the rate at which
it is replenished with fresh proxy IP addresses.
Churn determines how hard a censor would have to work
to keep a blocklist of proxy IP addresses up to date;
or alternatively,
how quickly a momentarily complete blocklist
would lose effectiveness.

We ran an experiment to measure churn.\urlfootnote{
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/34075
}
Our technique was to record the set of proxy IP addresses
seen by the broker over an interval of time,
then compute the size of the intersection with other sets
in nearby intervals (up~to 40 hours later).
Every hour, the broker recorded a snapshot of
proxy IP addresses it had seen in the past hour.
To~avoid the risk of storing real proxy IP addresses,
each snapshot was not a transparent list,
but a HyperLogLog++ sketch~\cite{Heule2013a},
a~probabilistic data structure for estimating
the number of distinct elements in a multiset.
Proxy IP addresses were hashed with a secret string
(discarded at the end of the experiment)
before being added to a sketch,
to~prevent their being recovered from our published data.
A~sketch supports two basic operations: count and merge.
Given a sketch~\(X\),
we~may compute an approximate count \(|X|\)
of its unique elements,
and given two sketches \(X\) and~\(Y\),
we~may merge them into a new sketch
representing the union \(X \cup Y\).
The quantity we are interested in,
namely
the size of the intersection of two sketches,
is~computed using the formula
\(|X| + |Y| - |X \cup Y|\).
This computation estimates
how many proxy IP addresses are shared between
two samples.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{figures/proxy-churn/proxy-count-decay}
\caption{
Proxy churn in January 2023.
The dark upper line shows the number
of unique proxy IP addresses in overlapping 24-hour windows.
The lighter, descending lines indicate
how many of the same IP addresses were in later 24-hour windows,
at~1-hour increments up to 40 hours later.
It~takes about 20~hours for 50\% of the proxy pool to turn over.
}
\label{fig:proxy-count-decay}
\end{figure}

The broker recorded churn logs between
\mbox{2022-07-22} and
\mbox{2023-10-16}.
\autoref{fig:proxy-count-decay}
shows results from January 2023,
which are representative.
Proxy activity has a daily cycle,
so~we merged consecutive sketches into 24-hour windows.
Starting from a reference window,
we~computed the size of its intersection with other 24-hour windows,
offset by \(+1, +2, \ldots, +40\) hours relative to the reference.
After 1~hour, the shifted window had, on average,
97.3\% of addresses in common with the reference;
after 12~hours, the fraction had fallen to 68.8\%;
after 24~hours, 38.2\%;
and after 40~hours, 27.6\%.

\subsection{Multiple bridges}
\label{sec:multi-bridge}

% "Prepare all pieces of the snowflake pipeline for a second snowflake bridge" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/28651
% "Distributed Snowflake Server Support" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/40129
% Ancient history from flash proxy: "allow the client to pick a specific relay for its registration" https://bugs.torproject.org/legacy/trac/10196

In the conceptual model of \autoref{fig:architecture}, the bridge
is a single, centralized entity.
It~\emph{can} be centralized
because it is never accessed directly,
but only via temporary proxies.
Unlike more traditional static proxy systems,
Snowflake does not benefit, in~terms of blocking resistance,
from having multiple bridges.
For reasons of scaling and performance, though,
it~can be useful for ``the'' bridge to be realized as
multiple servers.
Even with hardware upgrades and software optimizations,
our single bridge began to hit performance limits
in late 2022 (after the events in Iran of \autoref{sec:clients}),
and we had to find ways of distributing bridge capacity
to permit continued scaling.
Our deployment now uses two bridges.

There are many ways a multi-bridge system
might be designed.
In~ours,
the client tells the broker
what bridge it wants to use
(in~its rendezvous message).
The broker conveys the choice to the proxy,
and the proxy connects to the client's chosen bridge.\urlfootnote{
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/28651\#note_2786323
}
This may be compared to alternative designs
in which the decision of what bridge to use
is made by the broker or proxy.
Our design was largely dictated by technical constraints
related to interfacing with Tor.
A~different design may make sense with other deployments.

One minor consideration is the Turbo Tunnel layer.
Recall from \autoref{sec:data-transfer} that Snowflake
maintains a virtual end-to-end session
between the client and the bridge,
independent of the temporary proxies.
This is made possible by state stored at the bridge:
a~table of clients, reassembly buffers,
transmission queues, timers, and so~on.
% `type KCP` https://github.com/xtaci/kcp-go/blob/03b584b84eddd95cc03dbff65fc9cc5cbdf80c6b/kcp.go#L132
% `type UDPSession` https://github.com/xtaci/kcp-go/blob/03b584b84eddd95cc03dbff65fc9cc5cbdf80c6b/sess.go#L61
The state variables are not synchronized between bridges,
which means a client session begun on one bridge
must remain with that bridge,
because no other
has the context to make the packets
of the session meaningful.
When the client chooses the bridge,
this is easy to deal with:
the client keeps its choice consistent
in all rendezvous messages throughout a session.
If~the choice were instead made by the broker or proxy,
it~might be done by hashing
the client's session identifier string to an index,
as~long as the set of bridges does not change too frequently.

Another difficulty, harder to work around,
has to do with Tor bridge authentication.
A~Tor bridge is identified
by a long-term identity public key.
If,~on connecting to a bridge,
the client finds that the bridge's identity is not the expected one,
the client terminates the connection~\cite{tor-spec-negotiating-channels}.

The Tor client can configure at most one identity per bridge;
there is nothing like a certificate, for example,
to indicate that multiple identities should be considered equivalent.
This constraint leaves two options:
either all Snowflake bridges must share the same cryptographic identity;
or~else it must be the client that chooses the bridge
(and therefore knows what bridge identity to expect).
While sharing Tor identity keys across all bridges would be possible,
we~preferred to keep the keys independent,
so~that the effect of a security compromise
at a bridge would be limited to that bridge only.

A~client-chooses design risks misuse, if~not handled carefully.
Clients must not be able to
cause proxies to connect to arbitrary destinations---otherwise
proxies might be used in denial-of-service attacks, for example.
% "Clients cannot cause a proxy to attack or even connect to an arbitrary web site or relay..." https://forum.torproject.net/t/anyone-experiencing-problems-with-snowflake-proxy/6938/15
% An alternative vision: "(More) Distributed servers" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/40248
% Flash proxy: "Remove 'facilitator', 'client', 'relay' query string parameters. ...

To~enforce this restriction,
the client indicates its choice of bridge
not by an IP address or hostname,
but by an identity public key.
The broker maps the identity to a WebSocket URL
using its own database of known bridges,
and rejects rendezvous messages that ask for an unknown bridge.
% https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/blob/8e5ea8261110e97a8df56cfc9c83028081d902fb/broker/ipc.go#L187
After the broker tells the proxy what WebSocket URL to connect~to,
% https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/blob/8e5ea8261110e97a8df56cfc9c83028081d902fb/broker/ipc.go#L144
the proxy does its own check,
verifying that the hostname in the URL has
a known suffix reserved for Snowflake bridges.
So~there are two independent safeguards against misuse.

\section{Notable blocking attempts}
\label{sec:block}

In~\autoref{sec:clients} we saw how Snowflake's user counts
have at times been affected by the blocking actions of censors.
Now we take a closer look at selected censorship events.
The effect of censorship has usually been to increase, rather than decrease,
the number of Snowflake users.
This is no paradox:
as~censorship intensifies,
users are displaced from less resilient
to more resilient systems.
Snowflake's blocking resistance has not always been a success,
though, and here we also reflect on missteps
and persistent challenges.
The examples are taken from
Russia, Iran, China, and Turkmenistan,
and are selected for being significant and instructive.
Common lessons are that communication
with affected users is invaluable in quickly understanding and reacting to blocking;
and that blocking resistance is relative to a given censor,
because every censor's cost calculus is different.

Client count estimates come from the
Tor Metrics descriptors described in \autoref{sec:clients}.
Country code assignments use the same IP geolocation database
used by ordinary Tor relays and bridges,
and the caveats of IP geolocation apply to the per-country estimates in this section.
In~particular, we~have noticed that a fraction of clients
that geolocate to the United States are likely actually to be in Iran,
based on correlation of their dynamics with other clients that geolocate to Iran,
and with the timing of known political events.\urlfootnote{
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/40207\#note_2844116
}
The graphs of this section use the raw geolocation results,
with no attempt to adjust for errors.

Snowflake is blockable by any censor that is willing to block WebRTC.
We~would not try to argue otherwise.
Indeed, we~believe that the way to present a circumvention system is
not to argue for its absolute unblockability,
but to lay out
what actions by a censor would be necessary to block~it---or~more
to the point,
\emph{what sacrifices a censor would have to make}
in order to block~it.
Advancing the state of the art of censorship circumvention
consists in pushing blocking
out of reach of more and more censors.

on \mbox{2021-12-01}~\cite{ooni-2021-russia-blocks-tor}.
The event was evidently coordinated and targeted,
as~it happened suddenly and affected many Tor-related protocols at once.
Besides Snowflake,
a~portion of Tor relays and bridges,
as~well as some servers of
the circumvention transports meek and obfs4,
were blocked, at~least temporarily.
The blocking campaign was
less than totally successful---one
of its effects was to substantially increase the number
of users accessing Tor via circumvention transports,
Snowflake among them.

We~benefited from established relationships

found what traffic feature was being used to distinguish Snowflake.
It~was DTLS fingerprinting,
of~the kind cautioned about in \autoref{sec:fingerprinting}.\urlfootnote{

The extension being present in Server Hello was a bug\urlfootnote{

one that afforded the censor a feature

Snowflake was to become a significant tool
amid the general intensification of censorship in Russia
following the invasion of Ukraine in February~2022.

The Server Hello \mbox{supported\_groups} distinguisher
had been
discovered and documented by MacMillan et~al.~\cite[\S 3]{arxiv.2008.03254}
already in~2020.
We~might have avoided this blocking event by proactively fixing
the known distinguisher---but
it was not necessarily the wrong call not to have done~so.
There is always more to do than time to do~it;
one must consider the opportunity cost
of preempting specific blocking that may not come to pass.
In~this case, a~reactive approach by us was enough:
the loss was minor, and we were able to patch the problem quickly.
Even in ISPs where the blocking rule was present,
it~did not block 100\% of Snowflake connections,
because of the how it targeted a quirk in Pion,
and only in Server Hello.
When the DTLS server role in the WebRTC data channel
was played by a non-Pion peer,
such as a web browser proxy,
the feature was not present.
% The Snowflake client would retry its rendezvous repeatedly,
% until hitting on a proxy that worked.

In~May 2022 we got a report of a new detection rule,
this time keying on not just the presence, but the \emph{contents}
of the \mbox{supported\_groups} extension,
at~a byte offset suggesting that
it targeted the Client Hello message,
not Server Hello.\urlfootnote{
% "IRC Tip about Signature used to block Snowflake in Russia, 2022-May-16"
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40030
}
The presence of a \mbox{supported\_groups} extension in Client Hello is not at all unusual,
but the specific groups offered by Pion's implementation
differed from those of common browsers.
Though we confirmed the existence of the blocking rule,
testers reported that Snowflake continued to work---which
% "Snowflake works fine by the way." https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40030#note_2804998
% https://ntc.party/t/a-new-snowflake-blocking-rule-offset-of-supported-groups-in-dtls-client-hello/2420/2
may have something to do with the fact that the Snowflake client
does not always play the client role in DTLS.
If~the Snowflake client is the DTLS server,
and the DTLS client is a browser proxy,
then the byte pattern looked for by the blocking rule does not appear.
% Hard to say at this point, but perhaps it was the cause of the sharp drop in April 2022, only reported in May?
We~developed a mitigation,
but by the time we prepared a testing release in July~2022,
% "Creating a version of Tor Browser with patched Snowflake client that includes supported_groups censorship countermeasure" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/team/83
% https://ntc.party/t/testing-invitation-for-tor-browser-with-supported-groups-patch-countermeasure-in-snowflake-to-evade-censorship-observed-in-russia/2837
the new rule
had apparently been removed
and replaced by another.
We~can only speculate as to reasons,
but it may be that the old rule
had too many false positives,
or~was just not effective enough.

% "Блокировку Сlient Hello убрали, теперь блокируют Hello Verify Request" https://ntc.party/t/in-case-snowflake-rendezvous-gets-blocked/1857/9
% "They removed the blocking of Client Hello, now they block Hello Verify Request" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40030#note_2823140

The detection rule that replaced \mbox{supported\_groups} in Client Hello
looked for the presence of a Hello Verify Request message.\urlfootnote{
% "They removed the blocking of Client Hello, now they block Hello Verify Request"
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40030\#note_2823140
}
Hello Verify Request is an anti-denial-of-service feature in DTLS,
in~which the server sends a random cookie to the client,
and the client sends a second Client Hello message,
this one containing a copy of the cookie~\cite[\S 5.1]{rfc9147}.
It~is not an error to send Hello Verify Request
(it~is a ``MAY'' in the RFC),
but because the Pion implementation in Snowflake sent~it,
and major browsers did not,
it was a reliable indicator of Snowflake connections.
(Those, at least, in which the DTLS server role was played by
a Snowflake client or standalone proxy.)
This distinguisher, too, had been anticipated by
MacMillan et~al. in 2020~\cite[\S 3]{arxiv.2008.03254}.
The first reports of the blocking rule arrived in July~2022;
but as you can see in \autoref{fig:client-counts-ru},
it~had no apparent immediate effect.
It~is hard to say whether the drastic decline in October 2022
was a consequence of this rule,
or some other, unidentified one.
That decline coincided with an explosion of users from Iran,
which temporarily affected the usability of the whole system.
We~deployed a mitigation to remove the Hello Verify Request message
from Snowflake, regrettably, only in February~2023\,\urlfootnote{
% "Apply Snowflake Remove HelloVerify Countermeasure"
https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser-build/-/merge_requests/637
}, % and only in Tor Browser, no Orbot yet
after which the number of users in Russia began to recover.
% "Since the release of Tor Browser 12.0.3 on 2023-02-15 there has been an increase in users from Russia on both bridges." https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40030#note_2893870

The case of Snowflake in Russia illustrates
some of the complexity of censorship measurement.
The~answer to a question like ``Does Snowflake work in Russia?''
is not a simple yes or~no.
It~may depend on the date, the ISP,
and even such factors as which endpoint plays the DTLS server role.

\subsection{Blocking in Iran}
\label{sec:block-ir}

% "Unexplained drop in Snowflake client polls and bandwidth, testers wanted" https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/131
% "Tor censorship in Iran" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/team/96#note_2840481

% "Planning response to censorship in Iran with AC team" https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/team/-/wikis/Planning-response-to-censorship-in-Iran-with-AC-team

In~late September 2022,
users from Iran became the majority of Snowflake users almost overnight,
only to fall just as quickly two weeks later.
See \autoref{fig:client-counts-ir}.
The cause of the rise was
extraordinary new network restrictions amid mass protests~\cite{ooni-2022-iran-blocks-social-media-mahsa-amini-protests};
the cause of the decline was TLS fingerprint blocking,
which stopped Snowflake rendezvous from working.
The crypto/tls package of the Go programming language
(in~which the Snowflake client is written)
may produce several slightly different TLS fingerprints,
depending on hardware capabilities and how it was compiled.\urlfootnote{
% "...in native Go crypto/tls fingerprints since go1.17 is that the order of ciphersuites depends on whether the platform has support for accelerated AES-GCM"
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/40207\#note_2844163
% "There is strong evidence of an attempt to block the native Go crypto/tls fingerprint, but not all native fingerprints produced by Go programs are blocked." https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/125#issuecomment-1284602875
}
It~was one of these fingerprints that was blocked.
Because the blocking rule was so specific,
some users were affected and others were not.
% "This all gives us a good hypothesis... It includes the fingerprints of go1.17+ crypto/tls without AES acceleration" https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/139#issuecomment-1280243079
% "When I tested the desktop version, I did it in a VM that did not emulate support for accelerated AES-GCM..." https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/131#issuecomment-1280284051
Why would a censor block only one (even if the most common)
TLS fingerprint?
It~may have been a simple oversight.
On~the other hand, it~is not certain that the blocking
was meant for Snowflake specifically.
Go~is a popular language for implementing circumvention systems;
Snowflake may have been caught up in blocking that was intended for another system.

The fact that simple TLS fingerprinting worked to block Snowflake rendezvous
was carelessness on our part.
Aware of the possibility,
we~had already implemented TLS camouflage using uTLS
in the Snowflake client,

},
but we had to wait for new releases of Tor Browser and Orbot
to get it into the hands of users:
see the September--November~2022 interval in \autoref{fig:client-counts-ir}.

After repairing the TLS fingerprinting flaw,
the number of users from Iran gradually recovered
to near its former peak.
We~are aware of only minor disruptions after this time.
The default rendezvous front domain
was blocked (by~TLS SNI) in some ISPs
between \mbox{2023-01-16} and \mbox{2023-01-24}\,\urlfootnote{

},
which we confirmed using data from the censorship measurement platform OONI.
A~reduction in users is visible at this time.
AMP cache rendezvous continued to work.
OONI measurements in the weeks after the block was lifted showed sporadic
failures to connect to the front domain.
If~these were further attempts at blocking,
they did not have much of an effect.

\subsection{Blocking in China}
\label{sec:block-cn}

% "Investigate Snowflake blocking in China" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/32657

The user count graph from China,
\autoref{fig:client-counts-cn},
does not show any drastic changes
like others we have seen so far.
There is a modest but respectable number of Snowflake users in China.
Though there have been no singular, sustained events,
we~have seen evidence of short-term or tentative
blocking attempts.

In~May 2019, when Snowflake was still in alpha release,
a~user in China reported a failure to connect.
Investigation revealed that the cause was IP address blocking of
the few proxies that existed at the time.\urlfootnote{
% 2019-05-01 "I'm going to say that this a proxy blocking problem"
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/30350\#note_2593274
}
Rendezvous happened, and the STUN exchange worked,
but the client and proxy could not establish a connection.
We~experimented with running a proxy
at a previously unused IP address:
clients in China could connect when they were assigned
that proxy by the broker.
This was back before the web browser extension proxy existed,
and the only consistent proxy support was a few standalone proxies
that we, the developers, ran at a static IP address.
It~ceased to be an issue as the proxy pool grew in size.

That same month, we noticed blocking of
the default STUN server,
of which there was only one at the time.\urlfootnote{
% 2019-05-15 "access to stun.l.google.com:19302 was blocked"
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/30368\#note_2593357
% 2019-05-17 "it looks like the initial connection to the default STUN server is being blocked" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/30350#note_2593299

}
The solution was to add more STUN servers\urlfootnote{
% 2019-05-23 "Add more STUN servers to the default snowflake configuration in Tor Browser"
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/30579

and select a subset of them on each rendezvous attempt\urlfootnote{
% 2020-07-23 "Choose a random subset from given STUN servers"
https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/merge_requests/7
}.
Curiously, it seems that when the STUN server was blocked,
the standalone proxies that had been blocked earlier in the month became unblocked.\urlfootnote{
% 2019-05-27 "It seems once they blocked those stun servers, all snowflake bridges became reachable again."

The next incidents we are aware of did not occur until 2023,
recent enough to appear in \autoref{fig:client-counts-cn}.
On May~12, 13, and~14, a~few users reported problems
with domain fronting rendezvous.\urlfootnote{
% "Blocking of Snowflake in China, 2023-05-12"
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40038
}
We~could not get systematic measurements,
but it appeared that censorship was triggered
by observing multiple (two or three) HTTPS connections
with the same TLS SNI to certain IP addresses within a short time.
It~is possible that Snowflake was not the target of this
blocking behavior, and was affected only as a side effect.
If~it indeed had to do with Snowflake,
our best guess is that it was aimed at the multiple rendezvous
mentioned in \autoref{sec:multi-bridge}---though such a
policy would certainly also affect a large number of non-Snowflake connections.
The user count from China was about halved during those three days.
On~May~15, the blocking went away and user counts returned to normal.
% Reported at the same time, perhaps coincidental:
% "GFW at the Edge: Latest Development of China's Distributed Censorship System" https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/248

Also in May 2023, one user reported apparent throttling
(artificial reduction in speed by packet dropping)
of~TLS-in-DTLS connections,
based on packet size and timing features.\urlfootnote{
% "Potential TLS-over-DTLS blocking in China"
https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/255
}
Such a policy would affect Snowflake,
because it transports Tor TLS inside DTLS data channels.
Reportedly, adding padding to the first few packets
to disrupt the size and timing signature was enough
to prevent throttling.
Our own speed tests run at the time
did not show evidence of throttling,
with or without added padding.\urlfootnote{
% "Analysis of speed deficiency of Snowflake in China, 2023 Q1"
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/40251\#note_2906723
}
There was no obvious reduction in the number of users.
It~may have been a localized, ISP-specific phenomenon.

\subsection{Blocking in Turkmenistan}
\label{sec:block-tm}

There have never been more than a few tens of Snowflake users in Turkmenistan.
Even so, it~has happened at least twice
that the number of users dropped suddenly to zero,
as~shown in \autoref{fig:client-counts-tm}.
We~found a variety of causes:
domain name blocking
by DNS and TCP RST injection;
and blocking of certain UDP port numbers
commonly used for STUN.

Turkmenistan is a particularly challenging environment for circumvention.
Though relatively unsophisticated, censorship there
is more severe and indiscriminate
than in the other places we have discussed.
Only a small fraction of the population has access to the Internet at all,
which makes it hard to communicate with volunteer testers
and lengthens testing cycles.
We~have been able to mitigate Snowflake blocking in Turkmenistan,
but only partially, and after protracted effort.

The drop on \mbox{2021-10-24} was caused by
blocking of the default broker front domain.\urlfootnote{
% "Blocking of Snowflake in Turkmenistan, 2021-10-24"
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40024
% "On 2021-10-24, Snowflake users dropped drastically and thereafter went to zero." https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40029#note_2787789
}
We~determined this by
taking advantage of the bidirectionality of the Turkmenistan firewall.
Nourin et~al.~\cite[\S 2]{Nourin2023a} provide more details;
we~will state just the essential information here.
Among the censorship techniques used in Turkmenistan
are DNS response injection and TCP RST injection.
DNS queries for filtered hostnames receive an injected response
containing a false IP address;
TLS handshakes with a filtered SNI receive an injected TCP RST packet
that tears down the connection.
% "I did some tests to see if it would be possible to measure blocking of SNI and DNS from outside Turkmenistan" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40029#note_2787781
% "Bidirectional DNS, HTTPS, HTTP injection in Turkmenistan" https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/80
Conveniently for analysis,
it~works in both directions:
packets that \emph{enter} the country are subject to injection
just as those that exit it are.
By~sending probes into the country from outside,
we~found that the default broker front domain
was blocked at both the DNS and TLS layers.
% "...the block on Snowflake is effected by (at least) DNS and SNI blocking of the broker's front domain, cdn.sstatic.net." https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40024#note_2767094
It~was some time---not until August 2022---before we got
confirmation from testers that an alternative front domain
worked to get around the block of the broker.
% 2022-08-18 "broker rendezvous peer received" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40024#note_2829121
% We~did not get confirmation whether AMP cache rendezvous also worked,
% % "it would be helpful to ask them to try the AMP cache rendezvous." https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40024#note_2794947
% though our external testing indicated it would.
% % "www.google.com does not appear to be blocked" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40024#note_2767094

% This was not the only interference with Tor at the time.
% Five days later, on \mbox{2021-10-29}, Tor users not using circumvention transports
% dropped from about 1,000 almost to zero.
% https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40029#note_2787789

The increase in the number of users from May to August 2022
was caused by
a partial unblocking of the broker front domain on \mbox{2023-05-03}.
We~realized this only in retrospect,
from examination of data from Censored Planet~\cite{Raman2020c},
a~censorship measurement platform that had continuous measurements
of the domain at that time, in~one autonomous system in Turkmenistan.
% "@agix provided me with Censored Planet measurements of cdn.sstatic.net in Turkmenistan." https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40024#note_2930186
% See also figures/turkmenistan/ in this paper's source code.
There was a shift from RST responses to successful TLS connections on that date.
DNS measurements did not catch the moment of the shift,
but they also showed no signs of blocking after that date.
Evidently, some users were then able to connect.
But the unblocking must not have been everywhere, because as late as \mbox{2022-08-18},
users reported that RST injection was still in place for them
(though DNS injection had stopped).
% 2022-08-18 "wsarecv: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host." https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40024#note_2829106

% Connection Assist
% July 2022
% https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/rdsys/-/merge_requests/48

There was yet another layer to the blocking.
Even if they could contact the broker
(at~the default or an alternative front domain),
clients could not then establish a connection with a proxy.
% "...there's some progress in the sense that the broker connection is working now, but it looks like the client is having trouble connecting to the proxies." https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40024#note_2829140
% "connection failed timeout waiting for DataChannel.OnOpen" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40024#note_2829121
Testing revealed blocking of the default STUN port, UDP~3478.
% "And port 3478 is blocked in TM" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40024#note_2829127
A~client that cannot communicate with a STUN server
cannot find its ICE candidate addresses (\autoref{sec:connection}),
without which most WebRTC proxy connections will fail.
(The exceptions are proxies without NAT or ingress filtering.
While there are some such proxies,
censorship in Turkmenistan also outright blocks
large parts of IP address space,
including data center address ranges where those proxies tend to run.)
% "Even if the user is unable to connect to any STUN servers and sends an SDP offer with no candidates, they should still be able to connect to proxies that are not behind a NAT or behind a full cone NAT" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40024#note_2889789
As~chance would have it, the NAT discovery feature we rely on
for testing the NAT type of clients requires
STUN servers to open a second, functionally equivalent listener
on a different port~\cite[\S 6]{rfc5780}, commonly 3479.
Changing to those alternative port numbers
enabled some users to connect to Snowflake again.
% "this line... :3479... Works!" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40024#note_2829157
% 2022-08-25 "Use stun servers on port 3479 for turkmenistan" https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/rdsys-admin/-/merge_requests/4
Specifically, STUN servers on port 3479 worked in AGTS,
one of two major affected ISPs.
The workaround did not work in Turkmentelecom, the other ISP,
where port~3479 was blocked.
% "So the line where we switch to port 3479 only works for some people but not others?" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40024#note_2829235
Though we do not have continuous measurements to be sure,
we~suspect that the STUN port blocking began on \mbox{2022-08-03}
and precipitated the drop seen on that date in \autoref{fig:client-counts-tm}.

The blocking techniques described in this section are crude,
and surely result in significant overblocking---but
they nevertheless offer greater challenges to circumvention
than the more considered blocking of Russia and Iran.
We~highlight this to make the point that blocking resistance
cannot be defined in absolute terms,
but only relative to a particular censor.
Censors differ not only in resources
(time, money, equipment, personnel),
but also in their tolerance
for the social and economic harms of overblocking.
Circumvention can only respond to and act within these constraints.
The government of Turkmenistan has evidently chosen
to prioritize political control
over a functional network, to an extreme degree.
To~paraphrase one of our collaborators:
``What they have in Turkmenistan can hardly be called an Internet.''\urlfootnote{
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/censorship-analysis/40024\#note_2889792
}
In~a network already damaged by oppressive policy,
the additional harm caused by the clumsy blocking of
this or that circumvention system is comparatively small.
This shows the sense in which a resource-poor censor
can ``afford'' certain blocking actions
that a richer, more capable censor cannot.

\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future}

We~designed Snowflake to be useful today,
as~well as resilient to anticipated future censorship attacks.
Here we list some research questions that affect Snowflake
and circumvention more broadly.
The uniqueness and scale of Snowflake's deployment
provides a platform to help explore these questions.

\paragraph{What could alternative Snowflake deployments look like?}

A~natural extension of Snowflake would be
to base it on a system other than Tor, such as an ordinary VPN.
Tor has attractive privacy benefits
and a convenient framework for developing circumvention modules,
but it also has relatively low speed and lacks
support for non-TCP applications.
The prospect of multiple Snowflake deployments
raises the question of
how the proxy pool is to be managed.
Building Snowflake's population of proxies
has been an undertaking in itself---it~would
be a regrettable duplication of effort
if every project had to repeat the process from scratch.
Rather than retrofit existing Tor-based proxies,
a~next-generation proxy pool might be designed
from the ground up with multiple cooperating projects in mind.
There is also the issue of incentives:
while some proxy operators may be happy to donate
bandwidth to a free-to-use project like Tor,
they may need more motivation to help a commercial VPN,
for example.

\paragraph{How might proxy enumeration attacks be inhibited?}
% "TTP-03-001 WP1: Snowflake broker vulnerability" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/40329

The size (\autoref{sec:proxies}) and churn (\autoref{sec:proxy-churn})
of the Snowflake proxy pool
are obstacles to comprehensive blocking.
However, it~is worth considering
the maximum impact of enumeration attacks,
and ways to mitigate them while preserving usability.

\paragraph{What is a good (family of) traffic shapes?}

Snowflake does not yet attempt to shape its
traffic analysis features (\autoref{sec:fingerprinting});
but if it were~to, what shape should it use?
This consideration goes beyond just Snowflake.
Frameworks for proposing and evaluating
traffic shaping techniques are under-explored.

\paragraph{Can traffic splitting benefit performance or resistance to blocking?}

% "Multiplex - one client splits traffic across multiple proxies" https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/25723
% "I'm thinking of 'striping' packets across multiple snowflake proxies simultaneously." https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/anti-censorship-team/2020-February/000059.html
The Turbo Tunnel reliability layer of \autoref{sec:data-transfer}
lets us join multiple sequential proxies into a session.
In~principle,
it~also makes it possible to split traffic
over many proxies simultaneously, not just sequentially---something
like multipath~TCP.
Sequence numbers, retransmissions, and reassembly
would ensure a reliable stream, even when proxies
have different lifetimes and performance characteristics.
Multiplexing could reduce the performance impact of
a slow proxy, and
eliminate the brief pause for re-rendezvous
that now occurs
between consecutive proxies.
Our initial experiments with multiplexing have
not shown enough benefit to justify the change,
though it may be a matter of tuning.\urlfootnote{
% "...the multiplexing patch in !11 makes no difference in throughput (and in some cases seems to make throughput worse)"
https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/25723\#note_2718643
% "at least the multiplexed version is not slower than the regular version now" https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/merge_requests/11#note_2716658
}
And of course, analysis would be required
to determine whether simultaneous WebRTC connections
form a distinctive network fingerprint.
